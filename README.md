## Installations

### Git
Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source-code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files.

Download and install the latest version of git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Node
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.

Download and install the LTS version from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Yarn
Yarn is a JavaScript Package Manager, a direct competitor of npm, and it’s one of Facebook most popular Open Source projects.

It’s compatible with npm packages, so it has the great advantage of being a drop-in replacement for npm.

Download and install the stable version from [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

### Expo
Expo is a free and open source toolchain built around React Native to help you build native iOS and Android projects using JavaScript and React. For more information checkout the [Expo website](https://expo.io).

Install the Expo command line tool by running this command in your terminal: 

`npm install expo-cli --global`
